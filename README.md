# Sony PlayStation SIO-XS PSIO Quick Solder Switchboard

SIO-X is an elegant PSIO switchboard designed by Voultar to make switchboard installs simpler and neater. It comes with the addition of an onboard modchip, quick solder Board design, and a number of other improvements over the standard PSIO switchboard.

## What is SIO-XS?

For my own uses I prefer a separate modchip and switchboard install so I desided to design the SIO-XS. The SIO-SX simplifies Voultar’s PSIO switchboard design further by omitting the modchip and changing the layout a little. SIO-XS was designed from the ground up but is based entirely on Voultar’s work and SIO-X. So all credit to Voultar.

## Why is it called SIO-XS?
SIO-XS for eXtra Small. SIO-XS for Sans, in that it is sans-modchip. SIO-XS in that it removes the ‘excess’ so it is just a PSIO switchboard.
